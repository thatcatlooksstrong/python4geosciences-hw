1    A long, long time ago
2    In a galaxy far away
3    Naboo was under an attack
4    And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn
5    Could talk the Federation into
6    Maybe cutting them a little slack
7    But their response, it didn't thrill us
8    They locked the doors and tried to kill us
9    We escaped from that gas
10   Then met Jar Jar and Boss Nass
11   We took a bongo from the scene
12   And we went to Theed to see the Queen
13   We all wound up on Tatooine
14   That's where we found this boy...

15   My, my, this here Anakin guy
16   May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry
17   And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye
18   Sayin', "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
19   "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"
